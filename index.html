            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Kanye Omari West (aka Yeezy, Ye, Konman, The Louis Vutton Don) was born on June 8, 1977 in Atlanta, 
                Georgia, US by his mother, Donda. His mother was an English professor at Chicago State University and 
                eventually became his manager before she died at the age of 58 from heart complications after cosmetic 
                surgery in 2007. Her passing had a significant influence on Kanye musically as well as personally. 
                Kanyeâ€™s father, Ray, was also influential as he was a photojournalist for the Atlanta Journal newspaper 
                and politically active in the Black Panthers party.

            <h2>Music</h2>  
            <p>
                Kanye moved to New York in 2001 and got his big break handling the production for the Jay-Z track 
                "This Can't Be Life," which appeared on the 2000 album Dynasty: Roc La Familia. The following year 
                he began growing his reputation by producing four songs on Jay Z's The Blueprint album, which was widely 
                regarded as one of the greatest rap albums of all time.
